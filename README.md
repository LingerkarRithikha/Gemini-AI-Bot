# Gemini-AI-Bot

I have create a Conversational AI Data Science Tutor which is tasked to resolve only the data science doubts of the user.

Model: Gemini 1.5 Pro latest
Framework: Streamlit
Application: VSCoder

This AI Bot is only specified to Data Science related topics , thats why when I have asked an unrelated questions it couldnt't properly guide me.
So this shows that My AI bot is working correct to my instructions given by the developer.
